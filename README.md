# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms.
In this project, we utilized a variety of Machine Learning Algorithms, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM, and k-Nearest Neighbor, to predict diabetes in patients. We specifically utilized the Pima Indians Diabetes Database for this analysis. Additionally, we employed XBOOST to compare the accuracy of each algorithm.
